# Interactive Photo Gallery

This project was Project #5 as part of the Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree. For this project, I created the HTML and CSS while using stock photos to create an image gallery. I searched for and used a jQuery plugin named fancybox to display the photos in a lightbox. The lightbox allows the user to click on any image, cycle through the images, zoom in, and close the image to return to the thumbnails. The project also contains a search box which filters the image based on the image captions.
